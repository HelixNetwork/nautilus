## **Nautilus Wallet Terms & Conditions**
The Helix Foundation, Torellstr. 7, 10243 Berlin (“Helix”) is a non-profit foundation 
under German law with its seat in Berlin. 
&nbsp;
-  Helix has been developing a scalable, decentralized peer-to-peer DLT – 
     Distributed Ledger Technology – (the “HelixNetwork”). The HelixNetwork 
     includes its own native cryptocurrency, HLX (“HLX”). You can use the 
     HelixNetwork e.g. to send and receive [micro-]transactions, exchange 
     value, perform blockchain-level auditability, and get tamper-proof time-
     stamping guarantees. The aim is to create an ecosystem whose members 
     collectively work on building an environment to easily exchange digital 
     messages or value (the “HLX Ecosystem”). 
&nbsp;
    Helix has been also developing an HLX coin compatible wallet, called Helix Nautilus 
    Wallet (“Nautilus”). Nautilus solely enables its users (“User”, “you”) to access their 
    respective E-Wallet by mobile telephone or other mobile or desktop device. Helix 
    makes Nautilus available to the User via download. These Terms and Conditions 
    (“Terms and Conditions”) apply to the use of Nautilus and create a contract
    between Helix and the User (the “Agreement”), as long as and in as far as no other 
    agreements have been reached. \n
    BY REGISTERING IN THE NAUTILUS WALLET, YOU DECLARE THAT YOU 
    AGREE TO THESE CONDITIONS. By your agreement to the conditions 
    the Agreement is concluded.
&nbsp;

### **General Provisions**&nbsp;

- Helix’s Terms and Conditions apply exclusively. Deviating, conflicting or
   supplementary terms and conditions of the User or third parties shall not 
   apply even if Helix does not expressly object to their application in 
   individual cases.
- The contractual language is English.
- Some clauses only apply to the User if the User is a consumer [“Verbraucher”] 
   according to Section 13 German Civil Code (hereafter “BGB”) or 
   entrepreneur [“Unternehmer”] according to Section 14 BGB. The User is a   
   consumer if the User uses the software for purposes neither mainly 
   associated with the User’s commercial activities nor mainly associated with 
   the User’s self-employment. An entrepreneur is a natural person, legal 
   entity or partnership, which or who acts within their commercial activities or 
   their self-employment when concluding this contract. Helix expressly makes
   clear any limitation of applicability of the respective Section.
- The Terms and Conditions may be displayed on Helix official website 
  [https://hlx.ai/wallet.html](https://hlx.ai/wallet.html). The User is also entitled to print the Terms and 
   Conditions.&nbsp;

### **Nautilus**&nbsp;
- Nautilus is offered by Helix as a piece of software and is solely determined as a 
   user interface to communicate with the ledger through an application programming 
   interface (API). It is therefore important to note that 
- the "balances" are not stored in Nautilus, but in the HelixNetwork itself;
- Helix, in association with Nautilus, solely acts as a software provider, 
   and is not a crypto-exchange or a place for buying or selling 
   cryptocurrencies, and it is not another form of payment service 
   in terms of § 1 of the German Payment Services Supervision Act; 
   and
- Helix does not provide internet access or any other technical services 
   that are required to use Nautilus.
- Use of Nautilus is free of charge.
- Use of Nautilus is restricted to persons over the age 
   of 18 or the respective age considered to be adult in User’s country of origin.
- Nautilus must be downloaded and saved in the User’s device in order to use 
   Nautilus.
   &nbsp;
### **Seed-Creation and Log-In**&nbsp;
- The User must generate a seed when entering Nautilus the first time and 
   choose a seed password. The seed is needed in order to receive coins. 
   The seed is a private key containing 64 characters. The User has to store 
   the seed in a SeedVault file during the creation. Once the seed (i.e. public-key)
   is generated the user can generate an associated address and thus
   receive messages and/or funds. Helix will provide guidance in the process 
   and offer an interface for seed/address generation. If the user loses his 
   seed, the funds can’t be restored, not even by Helix.
- The User has to set up an account name.
- The User has to create two different types of password, a device-specific
   password for the use of logging in (Account Password) and a password the 
   User needs when the User wants to log in with the SeedVault file 
   (SeedVault Password). The passwords are solely saved in the respective 
   User’s Nautilus. 
- The User has to be aware that Helix can neither retrieve the User’s seed, nor 
   the User’s passwords if the User has lost them or forgotten them.
   &nbsp;
### **Use of Nautilus**&nbsp;
- The User undertakes not to misuse Nautilus. In particular, the User is not 
   allowed
    - to block, overwrite or change content belonging to Helix;
    - to use the software whilst utilizing a system or program that impairs the 
       security, integrity and/or availability of Helix’s systems and software, 
       or to disturb in other ways the proper and smooth functioning of the 
       software, or to access the software in an unauthorized way;
    - to use Nautilus if the valid law in the User’s country prohibits use or if the
       User is located in a state or region where trading with HLX coins is 
       prohibited or requires authorisation, special authorisation and/or 
       authorisation of any kind, which Helix and/or the User has/have not
       obtained in this state or region; and
    - to use Nautilus without sufficient experience, knowledge and 
       understanding of how Nautilus works and/or without fully 
       understanding the associated risks.
- The User agrees that
    - the User is using Nautilus at the User’s own risk;
    - the User is responsible for the safekeeping and use of the User’s seed 
       and passwords for Nautilus, including keeping access data secret 
       from third parties;
    - the User is responsible for the accuracy of payment information saved 
       in Nautilus and for keeping it updated, and that Helix is specifically 
       not obligated to check the User’s payment information;
    - updates for Nautilus are provided by Helix and that failure to update 
       can result in a security risk or even loss of the User’s HLX coins;
    - the User is responsible to determine which, if any, taxes apply to any 
       purchase or transfer of HLX coins the User makes in 
       correspondence with the use of Nautilus and that it is also the 
       User’s sole responsibility to withhold, collect, report and remit the 
       applicable taxes to the competent tax authorities; and
    - the User will immediately stop use of Nautilus if the 
      valid law in the User’s country prohibits use or if the User becomes located at any 
      time, in a state or region where trading with HLX coins is prohibited 
      or requires authorisation, special authorisation and/or authorisation 
      of any kind, which Helix and/or the User has/have not obtained 
      in this state or region.
- The User keeps Helix indemnified against all justified claims [“Der Nutzer stellt 
    Helix von begründeten Ansprüchen frei”] asserted by third parties based on 
    abusive usage following § 4.1 and/or § 4.2, unless the User is not 
    responsible for such violation. In this case the User also compensates Helix 
    for any damage that Helix suffers from abusive usage, including any costs 
    for legal defense. The User supports Helix in Helix’s legal defense.

###  **Grant of Licence**&nbsp;
- In the event that the User downloads Nautilus on the User’s computer, the 
   User’s electronic device or another platform, or access Nautilus in any 
   other way, Helix shall grant the User a revocable, non-exclusive, non-
   sublicensable, non-transferrable, free and limited licence for personal use 
   of, and access to, the respective Helix software (including all updates,
   upgrades, new versions and replacement software). The contractual use 
   includes downloading, displaying and running of the installed software.
- Helix can carry out updates and/or upgrades for fixing errors or adapting 
   Nautilus to the respective state of the art, and end the provision of Nautilus.
- The User is not permitted to reproduce, replicate, process, amend, supplement 
   or use any other of Helix’s intellectual property (e.g. Helix’s internet 
   addresses, Helix’s trademarks, Helix’s logos or Helix’s name) 
   without Helix’s prior permission.


###  **Warranties**&nbsp;
- Helix does neither warrant nor represent [“Helix übernimmt keine Gewähr”] that 
   the use of Nautilus complies with all applicable laws and regulations in the 
   User’s jurisdiction.
- Helix does neither warrant nor represent [“Helix übernimmt keine Gewähr”] the 
   functioning of the User’s internet access and other third-party services (e.g.
   cell phone services), that are required for the use of Nautilus.
- Helix expressly refers to the risks of the usage of web services. This particularly 
   pertains to risks arising from the transmission of malware, spamming 
   (unsolicited sending of advertising emails), password theft, electronic 
   burglary and manipulation, hacking and other forms of unauthorized 
   disclosure of user data, nuisances and forgery. Helix will take reasonable
   measures to minimize such risks. This does not constitute a guarantee. To 
   this extent the User uses Nautilus at the User’s own risk. 
- Maintenance, retrofitting and upgrades, errors or bugs and other causes and
   circumstances may lead to interruptions or defects of Nautilus’ operation. 
   Helix will eliminate technical failure as soon as possible within the scope of 
   Helix’s technical capabilities. 

###  **Liability**&nbsp;
- Helix shall be liable without limitation for damages insofar as the cause of the 
   damage is based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by 
   Helix, Helix’s legal representatives, executive employees or other vicarious 
   agents [“Erfüllungsgehilfen”]. For negligent behaviour of Helix, Helix’s legal
   representatives, executive employees or other vicarious agents 
   [“Erfüllungsgehilfen”], Helix shall only be liable on the merits in the event of 
   a breach of an obligation, the fulfilment of which is essential for the 
   achievement of the contract and on the observance of which the User may 
   regularly rely ["Kardinalpflichten"], and to the extent that Helix typically had 
   to expect the damage caused under the circumstances known at the time 
   of conclusion of the contract. Otherwise, the liability of Helix – also for 
   Helix’s legal representatives, executives or other vicarious agents
    [“Erfüllungsgehilfen”] – is excluded.
- The aforementioned limitation of liability pursuant to § 7.1 shall not apply to 
   claims for damages arising from injury to life, health or body, the 
   assumption of a guarantee of quality or fraudulent concealment of defects 
   by Helix. Liability under the Product Liability Act shall remain unaffected.
- The restrictions of § 7.1 and § 7.2 shall also apply in favour of the legal 
   representatives, executives or other vicarious agents [“Erfüllungsgehilfen”] 
   of Helix if claims are asserted directly against them.

###  **Final Provisions**&nbsp;
- If the User is a merchant, a legal entity of public law or an administrative body, 
   the place of performance [“Erfüllungsort”] is the seat of Helix.
- The laws of the Federal Republic of Germany apply to the Terms and Conditions 
   and to the contractual relationship between the User and Helix. The 
   application of German-international private law and of UN sale of goods law 
   is barred. If the User is a consumer, the choice of law does not cause the 
   User to be deprived of any protection granted to the User by mandatory 
   consumer protection regulations, which apply according to the User’s 
   domicile. Further, the choice of law does not mean that the 
   User has to enforce the User’s rights at a foreign court.
- If the User is a merchant, a legal entity of public law or an administrative body, 
   Berlin is the agreed place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising between the 
   User and Helix.
- The User is not allowed to transfer or surrender any rights or duties from these 
   conditions without prior written permission from Helix. The User is not 
   permitted to transfer the User’s Nautilus to a third party. Helix is entitled to 
   assign the existing rights and duties from the contract with the User to 
   another company. If an assignment takes place, the User will receive a 
   notification within Nautilus. This notification will also specify a period of time 
   within which the User can terminate the contract in case the User does not 
   agree with the assignment.
- Helix is entitled to adapt the Terms and Conditions at any time, unless material
   provisions of the contract (especially scope of the agreement, term, and 
   termination) are affected. This entitlement to adapt the Terms and 
   Conditions exists only if the equivalence relationship existing at the time of 
   conclusion of the agreement is disturbed to a not insignificant extent by 
   unforeseeable changes neither initiated nor influenced by Helix or if a gap
   in the provisions after conclusion of the agreement has arisen as a result of
   a change in the law or a declaration of the invalidity of the Terms and 
   Conditions by courts and if difficulties in the implementation of the Terms 
   and Conditions arise as a result of this gap, which can only be eliminated 
   by the adaptions. The User shall be notified of the amended Terms and 
   Conditions in text form (in writing, no signature required, e.g. the User will 
    get a pop-up notification in Nautilus that the Terms and Conditions have 
    been updated, and the link from where he can download the updated 
    version) at the latest six weeks before their entry into force. The 
    amendments will be deemed to have been accepted if the User does not
    object to them within six weeks after receipt of the notification. If the User 
    exercises the right to objection the amendments do not become part of the 
    agreement and the contract will be resumed unchanged. Helix will 
    separately notify the User about the possibility to object and the deadline to 
    do so. The right of termination remains unaffected.
- If any provisions of these Terms and Conditions are or become invalid or 
    unenforceable in whole or in part, this will not affect the validity or 
    enforceability of the remaining clauses.

    contact Helix in individual cases:
